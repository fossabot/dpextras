# dpextras
discord.py extensions containing some utility functions for stuff

This is my first module that I intend to release publicly

Note that this module is not meant for public use and contain tailored features that I deem important to use in my bots.

Somewhat stable code should reside in the `master` branch. The `develop` branch contains code that might break.

I am aware of the millions of other repos that probably do things that I do here already, but I'm the kind of person
that does stupid useless things.

# Installing
I do not plan to release this on PyPI for reasons. That means you have to take an alternative route 
if you want to use this.

This also unfortunately means it will delay your dependencies install by a bit (or a lot), sorry not sorry. 

```shell
# Using HTTPS
pip install git+https://github.com/kcomain/dpextras
